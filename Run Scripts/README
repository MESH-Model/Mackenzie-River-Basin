This folder contains the scripts used to run the MRB MESH model for climate and land cover/use change. The scripts contain some specific settings for the simulations on USASK Copernicus that need to be changed when run elsewhere.

1. Prepare.sh                           This script prepares folders, and creates link_inputs.nc.sh and mesh.slurm from templates
2. Settings.sh                          General startup settings that depend on the dataset (e.g. surface or 40m variable height). It sets the run name, and calls link_inputs_nc.sh to create links to the forcing files and other model setup files. It also modifies the CLASS.ini tempelate
3. link_inputs.nc.template.sh           A template shell script for linking forcing and model input files
4. mesh.template.slurm                  A template job script that sets the environment, the job requirements and calls the mesh_run.sh upon submission. The mesh run script can be either of the coming scripts. 
5. run_mesh.sh                          The main run script that edits the run options, runs MESH for spinning and continuous simulation, and post-processes the output (mainly for permafrost). It sources Settings.sh
6. run_mesh.LU.sh                       The main run script for running the land/cover change scenario on top of the climate change ones. It switches the ddb at the set times: 2021 and 2066
